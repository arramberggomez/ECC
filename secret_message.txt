I sat under the shade of the tree below Sweeney's Special after soloing Easy To Remember, and I just sat there in a daze thinking about the people in my life that I have lost. I just looked up at the steep, beautiful, colorful arÃªte that shot straight up in the sky. It was like looking at a pathway to heaven. I was sitting in the great hall of Odin (a great legendary god). I felt the presence of late, great climbing partner Jimmy Forester and my late nephew who grew as a climber and person before being taken from us. Both of them fought the great battle of life. As I sat there, I could see holds to start appearing. I asked a good friend Matt King to help me put this route up. I wanted to put it up ground up, but it was so steep and nothing to hook. So I rapped in only to realize that after a short rappel I was out in space. So I heel hooked and basically downclimbed/ rappelled in to install each bolt. After ab crushing and bicep pumping work, we had all the bolts in except 1 at the start of the traverse. Matt tried to pull me in but no way. We had to climb Sweeney's Special, and I tensioned way out left to install the last bolt as to make sure it did not take away the Sweeney's Special adventure. 6 tries later each with a biceps and forearm pumping attempt we have Valhalla: where warriors who die as heroes and legends in battle dwell eternally. Thanks, Matt, for the work and support.
